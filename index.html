	<h2>The Early Years</h2> 
	
<p>Mahi was a natural at sports, excelling at hockey, table tennis, badminton and as a football goal-keeper. After he had reached the top of the cricket world he was asked what he would have become if not a cricketer and he candidly replied he would probably have become a famous footballer, playing for one of the top Kolkata club side.</p>

<p >For the first time he had to move out of his beloved Ranchi and live in Kharagpur (two hours’ drive from Kolkata) which boasts of having the world’s longest railway platform. Tennis ball cricket tournaments were all the rage in Kharagpur and Dhoni was hugely popular at these events, attracting up to 20,000 spectators to watch his exciting batting. </p>

<h2>Playing for India </h2> 
	
<p>After Nayan Mongia was injured in the 1999 World Cup in England, it was Rahul Dravid who was forced to take on the gloves, a role he retained right through the 2003 World Cup and into part of 2004 as well. In 2000 Syed Saba Karim also briefly held the position before suffering a serious eye injury in Dhaka. In between Mongia was back briefly in 2001, followed the same year by Deep Dasgupta. </p>
